# Uber Clone App by HPDF TEAM T93 using nodejs as backend and react native as frontend developed as a part of team task during the HPDF internship.
## Contributers - VIKRAM ARJUN SHINDE AND SACHIN MATHUR.
This project is already hosted and is there on the Hasura's Hub for checking it out, here is the link for it - https://hasura.io/hub/projects/techieviki/uberappclone-t93
Do check it out on ur local systems and let me know about any known issues.
Do notice that I did used the Hasura services for this project like the "AUTH" for authenticating the users, the "DATASTORE" for storing the data regarding the projects and it was an awesome experience with it as it made my life as a developer a bit easy ;)
Also officialy my internship at Hasura is now completed officially and have already submmitted this full fledged app to them.
## I have added the official task documentation in the root folder of the repo.
